\section{Data set}\label{sec:data_set}

In this study, we analyze stocks from different continuously traded companies
in the S\&P 500 stock market index. Almost for the whole work, we use daily
adjusted closing prices of 200 companies from January 1, 1990 to December 31,
2020. All the data was obtained from
\href{https://finance.yahoo.com/}{Yahoo! Finance}. To verify the reliability of
our results, we additionally used data from Quandl \cite{Quandl} (Data from
\href{https://www.quandl.com/}{QuoteMedia} \cite{QuoteMedia} via Quandl).

In the particular case of the non-stationarity example in Sect.
\ref{subsec:non_stationarity} we use daily adjusted closing prices of 421
companies for the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006. We do
not use the 421 companies for the other analysis because half of this stocks'
data is not available between the time intervals we wanted to do the analysis.

All the companies used in the paper are listed in  \ref{app:stocks}.
