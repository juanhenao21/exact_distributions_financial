\section{Data set}\label{sec:data_set}

In this study, we analyze stocks from different continuously traded companies
in the S\&P 500 stock market index in different periods of time. We use daily
adjusted closing prices obtained from
\href{https://finance.yahoo.com/}{Yahoo! Finance}.

To compare the distributions, we use three different time intervals. The first
interval is between the years 1972 and 1992. In this interval we have data from
$K = 23$ companies. The second interval is between the years 1992 and 2012.
This interval is selected to compare with the results obtained in Ref.
\cite{non_stationarity_fin_guhr}. In this interval we have data from $K = 277$
companies. Finally, the third interval is between the years 2012 and 2020. In
this interval we have data from $K = 461$ companies. All the companies used in
the different intervals are listed in Appendix \ref{app:stocks}.
