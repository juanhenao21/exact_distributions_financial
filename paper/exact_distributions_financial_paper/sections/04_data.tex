\section{Data set}\label{sec:data_set}

In this study, we analyze stocks from different continuously traded companies
in the S\&P 500 stock market index in different periods of time. We use daily
adjusted closing prices obtained from
\href{https://finance.yahoo.com/}{Yahoo! Finance}.

To compare the distributions, we use two different time intervals. The first
interval is between the years 1992 and 2012. This interval is selected to
compare with the results obtained in Ref.  \cite{non_stationarity_fin_guhr}
and to extend this previous work with the new proposed distributions.
In this interval we have data from $K = 277$ companies. The second interval is
between the years 2012 and 2020. We want to explore the stock data for recent
years and validate the universal and generic results of the distributions. In
this interval we have data from $K = 461$ companies. All the companies used in
the different intervals are listed in Appendix \ref{app:stocks}.
