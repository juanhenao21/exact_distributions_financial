\section{Comparison with empirical portfolio returns}
\label{sec:comparison_returns}

% In Sect. \ref{subsec:key_concepts} we establish the fundamental quantities used
% in the price response definitions.
% In Sect. \ref{subsec:response_function_trade} we analyze the responses
% functions in trade time scale and in Sect. \ref{subsec:response_function_physical}
% we analyze the responses functions in physical time scale.
