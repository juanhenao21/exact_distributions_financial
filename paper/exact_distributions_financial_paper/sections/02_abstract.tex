\begin{abstract}
    Correlated financial markets are perfect examples of highly
    non-stationary systems. In particular, sample averaged observables of
    time series as variances and correlation coefficients are continuously
    fluctuating, directly depending on the time window in which they are
    evaluated. Thus, models that describe the multivariate amplitude
    distributions of such systems are of considerable interest. Extending
    previous works, we apply a methodology, where a set of measured,
    non-stationary correlation matrices are viewed as an ensemble for which
    is set up a random matrix model. This ensemble is used to average the
    stationary multivariate amplitude distributions measured on short time
    scales and thus obtain for large time scales multivariate amplitude
    distributions which feature heavy tails. We explicitly use four cases,
    combining Gaussian and algebraic distributions to compare the
    distributions with empirical returns distributions using daily data from
    companies listed in the Standard \& Poor's 500 (S\&P 500) stock market
    index in different periods of time. The comparison in the four cases with
    the empirical data reveals good agreement.
