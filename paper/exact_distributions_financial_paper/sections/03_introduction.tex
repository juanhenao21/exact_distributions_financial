\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

A bunch of different characteristics in complex systems can be tracked down to
non-stationarity \cite{non_stat_1,non_stat_2}. These systems lack any kind of
equilibrium \cite{comp_sys_1,comp_sys_2,comp_sys_3,comp_sys_4}. Financial
markets are perfect examples of non-stationarity as they fluctuate considerably
in time. In general, the business relations between companies and agents can
change due to market expectations. During state of crisis, non-stationarity
becomes dramatic.
